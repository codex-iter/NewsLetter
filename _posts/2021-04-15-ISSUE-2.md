### AWOL :
#### Pawan Kumar Gorai (batch 2017-21)

AWOL - Attendance Without Leave is an app which shows all the relevant academic details for ITER students. AWOL lets students to check their **attendance, semester results as well as college moodle website**. AWOL also helps students to manage their class bunks and  even alert students not to bunk more classes if attendance of the student goes down. AWOL was  developed by CODEX members, Java was used for developing the app and it helps us to manage our college attendance more conveniently. At last if  you are a student of ITER then you must try AWOL, you will definitely love it.   
Download AWOL from https://github.com/codex-iter/AWOL

### TRINETRA :
#### Adarsh Padhi(2018-22), ASVK Vinayak(2019-23), Ayush Kejariwal(2019-23), Gyanaranjan Sahoo(2019-23)

Recently Utkal Hacks 3.0 was organized and Team TechSpace participated and tried to solve the problem statement in a span of 15 days. We all know that biometric systems  in schools, malls, hospitals are now a big factor to concern during this COVID Pandemic as it involves direct contact tracing. So team TechSpace have come forward with an innovative approach of **E biometric attendance** where users can give biometric attendance from the Trinetra app which makes it 100% contactless service. Trinetra app also randomly sends notification for 3-4 times within the office hours and users have to give his/her attendance within 10 minutes and the location details of the user will be shared so that administrators can check if the user is present in the office or roaming outside after giving attendance. Team has also  made an admin panel website for the administrators so that they can monitor the employees more conveniently. 
So basically the Trinetra app covers all the loopholes of the present biometric system.

### VIDEO-GEO TAG : 
#### Gyana Sahoo(2019-23), Pawan Kumar Gorai(2017-21), Parag Bhattacharjee(2017-21), Sweeta Snigdha Sahoo(2018-22)

In Feb 2020 ITER, SOA(deemed to be University) conducted **Hackerwars 2.0** a 24 hrs Hackathon in which this team participated. This Hackerwars 2.0 was a screening round for selection of projects for Smart India Hackathon 2020 in which top teams will be selected.
They tried to solve the SIH problem statement(NM380).
During this hackathon they tried to make a **mobile application** in which we can record and play geotagged videos. Whenever their app is used to record videos, the coordinates (latitude and longitude) after every 10 seconds data are written to a kml file, which will later be written to metadata of the recorded media file as base-64 encoding. Once the recording is completed, the coordinates from the meta data are decoded and fetched to the cache memory and is parsed using google map API. There will be  a split screen which shows the recorded videos in the upper part while the synchronised map tracking will be shown in the lower part. Also their app will run on both android and IOS platforms. They completed the app during this hackathon and are constantly enhancing the app with multiple new features.

### WALLGEN : 
#### Subrajit Prusty (2016-20)

Wallgen is a project which generates **high quality poly wallpapers**. It also lets users choose their shape and colors, and generates beautiful poly wallpapers. This project is made in **python**, and it comes in the form of a website as well. Everyone should try out wallgen as it generates beautiful polygonal wallpapers.

### LINC :
#### Madhaba Patra(2018-22), Pritam Kar (2018-22)

LinkC is a website which allows users to store their important websites, social media handles, etc. in one place. LinkC basically links all your important details into one place and allows you to share with your friends. **NodeJs** was used while making this project and now LinkC is hosted on Heroku.

## ACHIEVERS' SECTION : 

### GROUP TCP MESSENGER :
#### Rohan Verma and Sonu Kumar Sharma (2019-23)

Group TCP Messenger is a **chatting application** which can be used to communicate over a shared network. Both Sonu and Rohan have worked hard for this project and implemented this project through **socket programming in Java**. They have also won the **1st prize** for demonstrating this project in **ICICC 2019** which was held at ITER, SOA.

### Scientists Invent a Machine That Generates Mathematics We've Never Seen Before 

Srinivasa Ramanujan, an Indian Mathematician who is well renowned for his ability to devise new mathematical conjectures. Most of these conjectures turned out to be well renowned theorems. There are very few people in the world with such capabilities.The researchers from Technion – Israel Institute of Technology have created a system  called Ramanujan Machine which could generate conjectures around pie, catlan’s and euler’s constant.The mathematical formulas formed using fundamental constants are very rarely discovered.This process could speed up using the Ramanujan Machine.

### New research could help lay the groundwork for future quantum communication networks and large-scale quantum computers

New Army-funded research could help lay the groundwork for future quantum communication networks and large-scale quantum computers.Researchers sent entangled qubit states through a communication cable linking one quantum network node to a second node.Scientists at the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering at the University of Chicago, funded and managed by the U.S. Army Combat Capability Development, known as DEVCOM, Army Research Laboratory's Center for Distributed Quantum Information, also amplified an entangled state via the same cable first by using the cable to entangle two qubits in each of two nodes, then entangling these qubits further with other qubits in the nodes.

### Researchers Levitated a Small Tray Using Nothing but Light

The task of levitating a small tray using just Light seems to be impractical, but is made possible by a group of people at University of Pennsylvania.They used the principle of Light-induced flow, or photophoresis. Here, due to this principle the specially coated Mylar plates would levitate solely by the power of light.The energy from the LEDs heats up the Mylar’s specially-coated surface under the plate. The propelling of the plates occurs due to energizing of air particles.The researchers claim that they could make this technology feasible to carry sensors upto unexplored mesosphere upto 50 miles overhead.
