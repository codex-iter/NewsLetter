### PDFHut : 
#### Sri Rijul Das(2019-23), Deepak Pattnayak(2019-23), Sourav Kumar Prusty(2019-23)

It is a notes exchange system where all the students of the university can get
any lectures notes, books, etc. in PDF form regarding their academics at one place.
This website is user-friendly, and facilitates upload and download 
functionality. In download section the student can get any lecture notes that 
are available in the database as per his/her needs. While in upload section 
if the student is willing to contribute to the cause of notes sharing then 
he/she can also do that. Not only students but also the faculty can use this
website as per their convenience if wish to do so. 
Developer’s intention for this website is that the faculties and 
students don’t have to struggle with the sharing process. 
The Developers intend to come with more innovative ideas in recent future.

### Gymstructor :
#### Sourav Bera (batch 2019-23), ASVK Vinayak (batch 2019-23)

It is an android app that enables users to do exercise and yoga in the comfort of their home. 
As during this Covid pandemic situation no one is able to go out of their house to gyms, yoga centres, etc. so the respective flutter developers came
up with this idea to help such peoples in the pandemic situations. The main idea of this app is to guide people through various exercises and yoga in form of tutorial videos. It also has BMI calculator that helps people keep track of their body fitness, it also provides healthy diet tips, all these at just the tip of your finger using the developed Flutter App. Apart from this they are trying to add many further updates in which people will be enabled to make direct video contact with their personal instructors if they are not satisfied with result they got with the use of the app.

### Speak Short :
#### Rituraj Gupta, Bikash Dash, Debashish Samantara (Batch 2019-23)

It is a website in which you get two utilities in the homepage namely
Text-to-speech and URL Shortener. 
As we speak of the Text-to-speech it is a web-app that makes your
device read out the articles for you. It can be used to read any language.
At present it supports only .txt file stated by the creator.
For this they’ve used web speech API, HTML, CSS, JS.
And the URL shortener works just fine like the earlier web-app.
It shortens your default long URL into a shorter and more sharable format. 
For this they’ve used PHP, CSS, SQL, JS.

## INTERVIEW SECTION :


### VEDANT NANDA, Batch of 2015-19, ITER :

#### Current Role: Associate Consultant, Microsoft

####  How did you prepare yourself for final year placement?


When I started off my preparations, I decided how much time I wanted to give to each topic in a week. It was very difficult to make that decision and find a perfect balance between everything, but I was focusing on preparing for the written exams and technical interviews as well. I prepped for written exams myself with my hostel roommates who were gracious enough to help me wherever I needed help. I also joined an institute “Confidence Factory” in BBSR for interview and GD preparation. Amidst all this I was trying to find time for brushing up on my technical skills as well and my friends helped me with it. I want to name some of my friends who helped me reach where I am today and all of whom got placed in campus recruitment as well: Nilamadhab Mohanty(Kloudgin), Siddharth Sahoo(Deloitte), Mites Mrinoy(IBM), Siddharth Nayak(Robert Bosch), Anurag Dhanuka(HighRadius).

####  How should one prepare oneself to be successful in the field of engineering?


 Very simple but effective success mantra: “Do what you love!!” 

#### How far do you think college plays a role in preparing a student for industrial and job situation?


 College plays a major role in building the foundation that one needs to be successful in the industry.College helps you in not only joining the industry, but it gives you a platform to build yourself up for different walks of life be it corporate, higher studies, entrepreneurship or whatever people are interested to do post college. From a CS student’s curriculum point of view, I see it getting updated very frequently to adhere to the industry norms which would benefit students when applying for jobs.

#### How was the first 2 years of college life like for you ? 


 First two years I was just having a good time in general. I  hadn’t started preparing for anything. I was enjoying my engineering days without much stress. Things were simpler, only things that were of concern were Assignments and Exams. Third year is when I seriously started preparing for placements. I would suggest everyone the same, to enjoy your engineering days and make the best out of it but not at the cost of academics.

####  What is the best way to learn something? Self-study through resources or having financed supervision?


There is no fixed best way to learn something new. Usually there are tons of free resources on all  topics but also the paid ones are better structured and might be more useful. I usually start off learning something new with a free resource and if I don’t find good enough materials then I go for paid courses.

####  How to maintain balance between our college study and self-learning?


 Tricky question!! But it depends on an individual’s time management skills. The person should understand what his key strengths and weaknesses are and based on that he/she should give appropriate time to each.

####  Does learning new things and technology as well as contributing to open source have any significance or we should rather only focus on our academic?


 Everything that you do has some level of significance. I will suggest if you are able to find time beyond your college academics then go ahead and learn or do whatever you want to. The more you try different things the better you get to know if that is something you are interested in doing.

#### What do you think is more important :  learning new things or being polished at one thing?


 From a Computer Science Grad’s perspective with new things coming up every now and then I feel we need to keep ourselves updated and not focus on only one thing, but that doesn’t mean knowing 2 % of 50 things. The best thing to do in my opinion is pick 3-4 things and be good enough to be able to answer questions on it if asked in an interview.

#### What will you advice the 1st year students to make them acquainted with the engineering field/life?


 To first year students I would say, pretty much everyone is confused and overwhelmed with a sudden shift from school to college. Best suggestion is interacting with your seniors, as many as you can and get their perspective on things that you think you should know but are clueless as to where to get the answer from. You would find folks with very different opinions on same topics also but go with an open mind and try to understand what they did in their initial days which helped them or just learn from their mistakes and their opinion on engineering or life in general.

####  What will you advice someone before starting the placement preparation?


 I will suggest if you are preparing for the campus drive then find out which companies visit, what roles they offer, the job description and what skill sets they usually look for. Based on that you can structure your preparation, also talk to seniors about their interview and preparation experiences and any tips that they could share.

#### What are your future goals?


 I haven’t thought that far ahead for myself yet. My short-term goal for now is to keep learning and gain more exposure to different things in the industry to broaden my horizon which will enable me in setting a long-term goal for myself.

### A long-lasting, stable solid-state lithium battery.

Researchers have designed a stable, lithium-metal solid state battery that can be charged and discharged at least 10,000 times -- far more cycles than have been previously demonstrated --- at a high current density. The battery technology could increase the lifetime of electric vehicles to that of the gasoline cars -- 10 to 15 years -- without the need to replace the battery. With its high current density, the battery could pave the way for electric vehicles that can fully charge within 10 to 20 minutes.

### Brain implants turn imagined handwriting into text on a screen.

A person paralyzed from the neck down communicated using the brain-to-text technology.Electrodes in a paralyzed man’s brain turned his imagined handwriting into words typed on a screen. The translation from brain to text may ultimately point to ways to help people with disabilities like paralysis communicate using just their thoughts.From  brain activity alone, the participant produced 90 characters, or 15 words, per minute, Krishna Shenoy, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at Stanford University, and colleagues report May 12 in Nature.
