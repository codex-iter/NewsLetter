### SOAUrl : 
#### Ayush Kejariwal, Rohan Verma, Nishant Chaudhary (Batch 2019-23)

SOAUrl is an url shortner with custom endpoints. One can track the stats of the shortened url i.e., no. of clicks, which device user is using.
This project is made with flask and Flutter for backend & frontend respectively.
User can use app or web for shortening their long url. After shortening user can track it from either app or web by just signing in using Google.
App has some extra features like qr code generator/scanner. User can generate their own qr and directly share it to the platforms. And when user makes or scans a qr the qr data is saved in history which user can refer back. User can also save a qr data to our server cause history is local and limited to 25 datas only. 
Soon it will show some in-depth stats like for last 24 hrs performance, and auto Delete feature i.e., link will be deleted after a certain period of time.
So, Better shorten it then regretting.

### Text-to-Speech : 
#### Suman More, Sahil Agarwal, Minal Rai ( Batch 2019-23)

This Web application aims to make education accessible to a greater population, such as those with literacy difficulties, learning disabilities, reduced vision and those learning a language.
We have made this application using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT AND BOOTSTRAP. We used the web speech API and it works with "Speech synthesis". It involves receiving and synthesising text contained within the app to speech, and playing it out of a device's speaker or audio output connection.This includes a set of controls for entering the text to be synthesized  and setting the pitch ,rate and accent to use when the text is uttered.
In future updates, We can extend this for converting pdf into audio book.
Also, we can do the reverse of text-to-speech i.e. converting speech into text.

## COMPETETIVE PROGRAMMING ROADMAP: 
### By Rahul Mukherjee (Batch 2018-22)

### What is Competitive Programming? 

It's basically a mind-sport where you are given a problem and you have come up with optimized solutions for given constraints with your coding skills. This helps in building our logical thinking and analytical thinking skills and most importantly your data structure and algorithms knowledge. 

### ➢ Step 1: 

Learn a language 

1: The most preferred language used in competitive programming is C++, Java. **C++** is usually preferred because it is flexible, very fast. C++ has many Data structures and Algorithms built-in library which makes it easier while coding. 

2: **Java** This language is also used widely in programming but one drawback is it is not suitable for beginner programmers because it is longer code to write and not beginner-friendly. 

### ➢ Step 2: 

Practice basic problems from these sites.

#### Hackerrank: [Visit Site](https://www.hackerrank.com/) 

I think this will be one of the best beginner-friendly websites for practicing basic problems. here there a wide range of problems from beginner to advanced. Even we can practice in different languages C, C++, Java, Python, etc... 

#### HackerEarth: [Visit Site](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/)

HackerEarth is an Indian company focusing on coding problems and hiring challenges. Even this platform provides good beginner-friendly questions. Here there will monthly contest held where you can participate. this website has tutorials for all practice topics. It hosts competitions conducted by various MNC's and Colleges 

### ➢ Step 3: 

Once you are done with the basics of coding and practicing it then it's time to learn Data Structure And Algorithms. 

This is the most important thing that should be learned and practiced. Having good knowledge of Ds&Algo will make up a more optimal solution for the problem we are trying to solve. 

Important Data Structures and Algorithm Topics: 
• Array 
• Stack
• Queue 
• Linked list 
• Tree's 
• Graph's 
• Hash table's 
• Tree's 
• Dynamic Programming 
• Divide and Conquer 
• Backtracking 

### ➢ Step 4: 

Next is completely based on your practice to be master in competitive programming."The more you practice the more you get stronger" 

There are different websites you can practice competitive programming 

1. Codechef: [Visit Site](https://www.codechef.com/)
2. Codeforces: [Visit Site](https://codeforces.com/) 
3. Topcoder: [Visit Site](https://www.topcoder.com/)
4. Sphere Online Judge: [Visit Site](https://www.spoj.com/)

## LATEST TECH NEWS: 

### 1. Scientists develop adaptive font that speeds up reading. 

Researchers have developed a computer font that adapts its appearance based on the user's interaction with the text. ''AdaptiFont'' measures a user's reading speed and interactively changes the font's shape seamlessly and continuously to allow the user to read text more easily. By employing an artificial intelligence algorithm, new personalized fonts are generated on the fly in such a way that they increase an individual reader's reading speed.

### 2. New material could create 'neurons' and 'synapses' for new computers. 

Classic computers use binary values (0/1) to perform. By contrast, our brain cells can use more values to operate, making them more energy-efficient than computers. This is why scientists are interested in neuromorphic (brain-like) computing. Physicists have used a complex oxide to create elements comparable to the neurons and synapses in the brain using spins, a magnetic property of electrons.

### 3. Artificial intelligence enhances efficacy of sleep disorder treatments. 

In a new study, researchers from the University of Copenhagen's Department of Computer Science have collaborated with the Danish Center for Sleep Medicine at the danish hospital Rigshospitalet to develop
an artificial intelligence algorithm that can improve diagnoses, treatments, and our overall understanding of sleep disorders.

### 4. Major Scientific Leap: Quantum Microscope Created That Can See the Impossible. 

In a major scientific leap, University of Queensland researchers have created a quantum microscope that can reveal biological structures that would otherwise be impossible to see.This paves the way for applications in biotechnology, and could extend far beyond this into areas ranging from navigation to medical imaging.The microscope is powered by the science of quantum entanglement, an effect Einstein described as “spooky interactions at a distance.”

### 5. New Neptune-Sized Exoplanet Discovered With a Substantial Atmosphere Ripe for Study. 

An international group of collaborators, including scientists from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and The University of New Mexico, have discovered a new, temperate sub-Neptune sized exoplanet with a 24-day orbital period orbiting a nearby M dwarf star. The recent discovery offers exciting research opportunities thanks to the planet’s substantial atmosphere, small star, and how fast the system is moving away from the Earth.

### 6. New Magnetic Nanomaterial Developed for Counterfeit Money Prevention. 

An international research team led by NUST MISIS has developed a new iron-cobalt-nickel nanocomposite with tunable magnetic properties. The nanocomposite could be used to protect money and securities from counterfeiting.Presently, research on magnetic nanomaterials with controlled magnetic characteristics is one of the most promising fields. Due to their small size, as well as their excellent magnetic and electric properties these materials have a broad range of potential applications from mobile devices to space technologies.
