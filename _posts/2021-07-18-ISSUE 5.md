### The Mood Match- Finding Peace :
#### Abhinandan Roul (Batch 2019 -2023)

The project is in public showcase by Stanford CodeInPlace 2021.
This idea occurred to me keeping in mind the worsening mental health conditions of people amidst the pandemic and social isolation we all are facing right now.
It's a platform to match people having similar emotions. Each person is required to evaluate themselves on the six basic emotions like Happiness, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, Anger, and Surprise on a scale of 1 to 10. These are the basic emotions identified by psychologist Paul Eckman which were generalized across all human cultures.
Then, a mood index is created for each person based on the intensity of each emotion for a person. Finally, the platform matches people having similar mood indexes.

### 4. Team find brain mechanism that automatically links objects in our minds.

The findings appear in Nature Communications.
