### SOAUrl : 
#### Ayush Kejariwal, Rohan Verma, Nishant Chaudhary (Batch 2019-23)

SOAUrl is an url shortner with custom endpoints. One can track the stats of the shortened url i.e., no. of clicks, which device user is using.
This project is made with flask and Flutter for backend & frontend respectively.
User can use app or web for shortening their long url. After shortening user can track it from either app or web by just signing in using Google.
App has some extra features like qr code generator/scanner. User can generate their own qr and directly share it to the platforms. And when user makes or scans a qr the qr data is saved in history which user can refer back. User can also save a qr data to our server cause history is local and limited to 25 datas only. 
Soon it will show some in-depth stats like for last 24 hrs performance, and auto Delete feature i.e., link will be deleted after a certain period of time.
So, Better shorten it then regretting.

### Text-to-Speech : 
#### Suman More, Sahil Agarwal, Minal Rai ( Batch 2019-23)

This Web application aims to make education accessible to a greater population, such as those with literacy difficulties, learning disabilities, reduced vision and those learning a language.
We have made this application using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT AND BOOTSTRAP. We used the web speech API and it works with "Speech synthesis". It involves receiving and synthesising text contained within the app to speech, and playing it out of a device's speaker or audio output connection.This includes a set of controls for entering the text to be synthesized  and setting the pitch ,rate and accent to use when the text is uttered.
In future updates, We can extend this for converting pdf into audio book.
Also, we can do the reverse of text-to-speech i.e. converting speech into text.
