CODEX club of ITER brings you the CODEX Newsletter. It was started in March 2021, as a CODEX-members-only Newsletter. Now it's expanded to all students of ITER. The primary motto of this Newsletter is to feature wonderful contributions, projects, research works, achievements, etc. by ITER students and share them with the public. This will promote a healthy coding culture and spread awareness all across ITER students. It will motivate students to learn from each other, and explore the vast sea of Computer Science. The Newsletter also includes updates on coding events, competitions, opportunities, tech news, etc.
