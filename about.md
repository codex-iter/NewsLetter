CODEX is the first and official coding club of ITER. There are over 100 members in this club. There are different workshops, events and meetups organized by our coordinators, where the club members learn, collaborate and work on various projects in different domains of technologies.

The CODEX-NewsLetter was started in the month of March 2021. The purpose of this NewsLetter is to collect all the good works done by our members and bring them forward to the public in the form of a newsletter. This gives the members the opportunity to showcase their accomplishments, contributions and projects. Moreover, this newsletter is also meant to appriciate our members for their achievements in their career. The newsletter includes updates about tech news, coding competitions, various programs, internship and job opportunities, and many more.

We, the newsletter group, believe that a good community is one which has active members with visible collaborations and actions. Therefore, we hope that this newsletter will also serve its purpose to motivate our CODEX members to keep up their good work and build more exciting projects in future. Contact us on our CODEX telegram group or email us to include your work/project in our NewsLetter.
